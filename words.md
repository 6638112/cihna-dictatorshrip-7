## Rationale for word choice

-   recent cases receive a large prime over raw death toll, because older cases can always be attributed to other people.

    I've heard there is even some opening towards acknowledging the Great Famine, thus 烏坎事件 (and others from my previous profile names)

-   words must refer to a precise event, and must be clearly summarizable in very few chars, for increased impact, and profile name length limitations.

    E.g. "High corruption rates, high pollution", although very serious, feel too generic.

-   events that relate directly to freedom of speech receive a prime, since they can only happen in China and very few other countries.

    E.g.: Falun Gong, Tiananmen.

    Non e.g.: corruption and pollution. Those are hard to quantify, and there is always an immediate reply: china GDP per capita is low, same happens in India, Brazil, etc.

    Freedom of speech however, is immediately verifiable (e.g. "my Weibo was taken down"), and undeniably caused by the current central government.
