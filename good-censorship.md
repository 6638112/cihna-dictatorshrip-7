# Good censorship

Since I'm making a list of what I think should not be censored, I should also make a list of what I think should be censored:

-   how to make / buy:
    - weapons
    - illegal drugs
-   child porn
-   intellectual property leaks

This that I think should *not* be censored:

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration
-   making fun of political figures, most notably president / PM / chairman
