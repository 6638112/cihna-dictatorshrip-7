# FAQ

## Why are you attacking websites with censored keywords?

To increase the cost of censorship.

If commies censor things, they will get worse IT technology, and thus less rich.

## Do you hate China?

On the contrary. China is my favorite country. It has many, many wonderful things. As Bjarne said:

> There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses

I only focus here on negative things to provide content that will activate the Great Firewall.

## This repository is completely biased against the Chinese Government!

I prefer the term focused :-)

That being said, I take the agenda of information sources very seriously.

E.g. I try to clearly classify Communist Party and Falun Gong linked sources.

## Are you a radical?

Radical: I don't consider myself a radical because I actually have doubts about doing this sometimes.

Also I don't consider the Chinese Government Evil or anything like that. To me, it's just another non-democratic empire like the Qing Dynasty. 共产朝 as I call them. But alas, I'm not the inventor of the expression: <http://web.archive.org/web/20161025220242/http://tieba.baidu.com/p/752094668>

I never get mad. Only a slightly sad or annoyed sometimes.

But I do admit that I am hard headed like almost all humans, and it is very unlikely that anything anyone says will change my mind about subjective political matters.

In the end I just end up thinking about new replies to those arguments and adding them to this FAQ.

But maybe no radical ever considers himself radical? Hmmm...

## Are you a SJW?

SJW: there is a seed of SJW in me.

One major difference between me and the stereotypical SJW is that I never engage in lengthy discussions.

I believe that you cannot change people's mind's, and that learning tech is more worthy of my time.

I limit myself to listening as much as I can to learn new arguments.

So the rationale of my actions is *not* to convince anyone, but rather:

- increase the monetary cost of censorship by binding politics to tech
- group up like minded people who don't like censorship

## If programming websites get blocked, there will be less good programmers to fight against the dictatorship

This is a good point, and one that does make me think.

1.  The commies calculate their actions very well to stay in power.

    Why don't they just take down the entire Internet like they did in Xinjiang in 2010?

    Because that would hurt them:

    - people would go mad, and revolt
    - people would work less efficiently, making the country, and thus themselves, poorer

    So this puts pressure on them to take away the firewall.

1.  Programmers are more likely to develop better Firewall climbing tools if SO is blocked

1.  If we don't take any action to show our dissatisfaction, the dictatorship never ends.

    The commies exist like any other organization for a sole purpose: maintain their own power.

    If nothing is done to show dissatisfaction, they will never give up on that power.

    There are two extremes of action (both which *I don't* support):

    - everyone become a willing mindless slave of the leader: perfect stability
    - everyone take up arms and do terrorism: perfect instability

    But between those two extremes, what is the right measure? I think that saying nothing is too close to stability.

    I do see that one alternative scenario is that if we do nothing, maybe there will be more and more contact with Western countries, and the Chinese will see for themselves that we are not that bad, and eventually request democracy.

1.  Even if programmers get very powerful, it is not very likely that they will succeed to undo the dictatorship, they simply don't have enough power.

    I'd rather have a less strong dictatorship, than one with good programmers.

## You are harming the Chinese programmers

What is the root of the harm: me or GFW?

## There are bad things happening all over the world, why don't you fight for those causes as well / instead?

We have to choose the one we think is the worst, and focus on it.

What is worse is a subjective choice. For me:

1. I love China and my Chinese GF
1. I hate dictatorships, and China is the largest one

My SO username and protest time are not infinite.

## You are not Chinese, you can't interfere in Chinese politics

1.  If I lived under a dictatorship, I would welcome foreign intervention.

    Even if you don't, I know several who do.

1.  The commies say that all foreigners are bad.

    I disagree. There are good and bad ones.

    The commies do this because most foreign countries are telling the Chinese to get rid of the dictatorship.

1.  We live in the same world.

    If China's economy is bad, my economy is worse.

    If China's environment is bad, my environment is worse.

    If China starts a war, I might have to fight it.

1.  You can't do anything about it.

## You are not Chinese, you have been brainwashed by the USA know nothing about China

I don't doubt that you know more about China than me.

If you know something I don't, please tell me, I always want to learn.

But if you are Chinese, also consider that you have been brainwashed by the commies, and likely more than me since you live in a dictatorship.

## In the Tweet you say "correctional facility", but reeducation through labour has been abolished

My bad [here](https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576), the precise term is "jail". I'm *not* talking about: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_through_labor> Unfortunately I can't edit a Tweet.

## You have nothing to lose by doing that, but we Chinese programmers do

I think I have the most to lose personally: no enterprise who wants to do business with China will ever hire me for a high position.

I also have an increased risk of being hacked.

Chinese programmers all know how to climb the wall.

## This is your personal problem, we have nothing to do with it, stop punishing us for it

We have to fight for justice for our fellows, or else when injustice happens to us, no one will fight for use either.

Every form of protest incurs some damage. E.g., if we manifest on the street, it generates a traffic jam.

I don't like it, but I think it is worth it.

## What you are doing will never have any effect

That is true with high probability, just like any other individual which tries to influence 1B people.

Every action is statistical: I just push the balance a little bit towards freedom.

And if we never start somewhere, nothing will ever happen.

To have an idea, in 2015 there are about:

- 20M developers in the world
- 2M in China : <https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world> <http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/there-are-185-million-software-developers-in-the-world-but-which-country-has-the-most/>
- 5M Stack Overflow users <http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/227868/select-count-from-users>

## You are using Stack Overflow in a way that it was not meant to be used, so what you are doing is in principle wrong

This is somewhat true, and I don't like myself for it.

But I think freedom is worth it.

Any act of protest will use things in ways that it was not meant to be used.

For example, the street is not meant to showcase protest banners, it is meant to be a passageway for cars.

Making a statement where no one will ever see it, like a personal website, is sure to have no effect.

Finally, it is up to the Stack Overflow community to decide what is right or wrong, and so far the consensus is go ahead:

- <http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/298950/are-political-profiles-that-could-possibly-affect-the-participations-of-other-us>
- <http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok>

## The Chinese masses are still uneducated, and not fit for free speech and democracy

When will they be ready? Who decides? What if they think that they are ready now?

## Does your employer support this?

My employer has nothing to do with this.

He doesn't approve or disapprove of the Chinese government or of my private actions.

The only thing that my employer *does* believe in is that employees can have their own political opinions, and that this should not affect hiring decisions.

Obviously, this action limits my ability to lead high profile deals with China.

Also I'm quite curios if this would limit my ability to go to China for business, but I haven't applied for a visa since I've started this.

But my employer believes that inclusion and non-discrimination is more valuable.

I will always do my best to not let my personal opinions affect my professional decisions, as that would be unfair to my employer.

## Stack Overflow could be blocked at no cost by the Chinese government

Hitting the block button has of course no cost.

The cost of blocking Stack Overflow lies of course in the loss of information, and slower technological development.

## Were you influenced by the Cute cat theory of digital activism?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cute_cat_theory_of_digital_activism>

Nope, someone told me about it after a while, but it is basically what I'm doing.

## Falun Gong

### Do you support FLG, or just use it because it is a censored?

I support freedom of religion.

I believe that individuals should only be put in jail for what they do, not for what they believe.

I consider FLG a religion, and I am against its ban, as I am for all other religions.

Also I believe that freedom of speech and democracy imply that FLG and other religions will exist. If you want freedom, you have to accept other people's choices.

Otherwise, democracy and communism can also be considered as religions, and banned.

### Many people have died because they stopped taking medication because of Falun Gong, you should not support it

<http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab>

This is a point that makes me worry, but consider:

- what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship
- maybe people should be allowed to choose how they want to die, not to take medication if they don't want to
- maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication
- several religions, including Christianism have miraculous cure claims
- maybe the main reason why communists banned FLG is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well?
- maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication
- maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyways.
- riding motorcycles and smoking also reduce people's lifespan. Forbidding them, also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?

### Falun Gong is completely different in the West than it was in China

I believe that it has changed.

It has become more organized.

People in China are better educated in general, and discourse must be different to appeal to them, e.g. underplaying the religious aspect.

If you know more ways in which it has changed, let me know.

But I still don't think it justifies the ban.

And once again, we can know nothing for sure about the past in China because of censorship.

Even if you saw something yourself, how can you be sure that it is representative?

And now that it has changed, maybe China should unban it?

### FLG is dangerous because LHZ has too much power over followers

I agree that there is danger in every religion, and specially new religions.

However the same point can be made about political parties and in particular the CCP and its chairman.

Couldn't a charismatic leader chairman gain more and more power (like Xi seems to be doing), and eventually start a war and kill millions? Or just kill some minority which is not happy about the situation.

Similarly, any charismatic leader of a pro democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.

If you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.

### FLG downplays the fact that it is a religion

I think that most people in the West would classify FLG as a religion if they are told that it mentions higher intelligent beings, other dimensions, and have weekly meetings where they read from a sacred book.

Or a cult, which is nothing but a new / small religion with negative connotation, and thus meaningless.

But consider this: how to classify what a religion is?

Some would answer: science is what everyone can perceive with their own senses.

But FLG followers claim to feel FLG energies when doing the exercises, and a few of them have the power of seeing the other dimensions.

On the other hand, how many of your friends have experienced the laws of quantum field theory or general relativity in a very direct way?

### FLG media is not transparent about its affiliation

Agreed, and it is a point that hurts more than helps their cause: e.g. New Tang Dynasty TV, Epoch Times and Shen Yun Dance group.

But are all media forced to state their affiliation?

If so, then we should force *all* newspapers start taking pools of how many employees follow which religion, and put that in their print.

### FLG is illegal in China, we must follow the law

This might be a bad law that should be changed.

### FLG is a (fake|evil) religion

Similar to the question: does God exist?

And thus unanswerable, and not interesting to me.

### Many people both are against censorship and FLG

I know that, and that supporting FLG is "bad" for my public image with most Chinese, including those that are against censorship.

But without censorship, there will be democracy, and with democracy FLG followers will have voting rights, and FLG will become legal.

I think the situation is very similar to Scientology in the USA today: most people dislike it, but believe that you can believe whatever you want.

Democracy and Communism can also be considered as religions and persecuted.

Isn't it convenient when a dictatorship gets rid of those weirdos for you? But not so much when suddenly you or your family is the weirdo...

### Many people say they do FLG only to get VISAs to the USA

Heard this a few times, but I don't see how this is relevant at all:

- if they are not really FLG believers, this says nothing about the real FLG believers
- if they are, then why wouldn't they seek a VISA, since they are in constant threat of going to jail?
