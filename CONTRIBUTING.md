Forbidden:

-   at mention @cirosantilli unless there is moderation need.

    If Ciro unsubscribed from a thread, it means that he does not want to reply there anymore.

    Create a new issues instead if it makes sense.

-   generate lots of notifications that don't teach people anything new.

    If you want to shitpost, fine, but keep the number of issues and comments small.

    People don't have that much time to waste.

-   swearing/being very aggressive on a [`not-shitpost`](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship) post.

    Keep in mind that [Ciro's Chinese sucks](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese), so he may not get the full nuance of your comment, especially if you use a ton of [slang](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship#slang).

    On `shitpost` posts however, you can be as aggressive as you want.

Punitive measures, from least serious to most serious:

-   block user on one website. This may have the unintended side effect of deleting previous useful comments the user made on the websites. 

-   delete comment or vandalize the user's post.

    Actually, the main reason Ciro Santilli bans non-notification generators is not that he gives a fuck about the insults, but rather that he wants to prevent the OP from editing away his amazing post vandalisms.

-   ban all known accounts of an user over multiple websites

Constructive disagreement will never be interfered with.

If you wish to appeal a punitive measure, please contact me through some unblocked method, and your request will be reviewed. "I'm sorry I got mad that time" will get you out of jail for first time offenders.

I will not reply anything non-trivial on Chinese websites, since all of those will be taken down sooner or later, therefore wasting my time. I will just tell you to recontact on a non-Chinese website, or re-post your question with the answer on a Western website.

If OP someone shitposts on GitHub and gets blocked, I will just make that clear by taking a web archive, posting a link on my comment, and setting the `op-block` label on the person's post: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/op-block
