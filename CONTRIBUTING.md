## Swearing

Swearing is forbidden:

- if your post contains nothing but swearing, you will be blocked
- if your post contains swearing and content, you will be warned and required to edit your post. If you do it again, you will be blocked

Constructive disagreement will never be interfered with.

What constitues swearing is hard to define, and will be decided by the dictators of this repository.

Keep in mind that my Chinese sucks, so I may not get the full nuance of your comment.

But in general, if you waste my time with a non-nice notification without teaching me anything, you are at grave danger of losing the invaludable priviledge to commenting on this repo.

If you with to appeal a block, please contact maintainers through some channel other than GitHub, and your request will be reviewed.
