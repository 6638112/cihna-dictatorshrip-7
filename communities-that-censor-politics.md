# Communities that sensor politics

Considering only websites not hosted in China of course, which are all censored already.

I'm not this user: <https://github.com/cirosantilli-lovechina> who only contributes to such projects.

Well, will likely be the case for a large proportion of projects:

- controlled by Chinese people
- controlled by enterprises, which only care about making money

But here we go:

- Urho3D <https://urho3d.github.io> on comment by Yao Wei Tjong <http://archive.is/n7P3I> The thread was later deleted, and my other threads had the links removed and were closed: <http://archive.is/xK2LL> and <http://archive.is/bfHou> An interesting side effect of this is that no-one in that forum can ever link to my posts since that website fetches titles, images and more. Waiting to see if they will add clear guidelines, or just use the Chinese method of having de-facto unsaid rules. It will be even more fun when my name itself becomes a censored keyword, and other people have at mentioned me. <https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/2216> <http://archive.is/MgFJ2>
