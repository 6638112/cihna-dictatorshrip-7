# Taiwan

The fact that the world does not consider Taiwan a country is a joke.

It reflects the West's disunion in standing up to the CCP.

There was a civil war, the countries split. This is how every single country in the world got formed in the first place.

If Taiwan is a part of China, why doesn't China put the Chinese flag on all major Taiwanese government buildings?

Oh, I forgot, it is because they have absolutely no control over Taiwan. Just like the have absolutely no control over any other country.

China, if you want to claim tha Taiwan is a part of you, just invade them already. Or just stop this joke.

Someone once said:

> Taiwan should not be considered a country by China, because then it would not join back to China when China becomes a democracy, and would be used by the USA to do evil things like they did in the Middle East

Reply: China claiming that Taiwan is a part of them only drives Taiwan closer to the West! Who wants to be part of a dictatorship?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-China_policy> every country has private relations with Taiwan through some trade organizations, they just don't call them embassies.
